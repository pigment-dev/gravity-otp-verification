A powerful plugin for Gravity Forms that adds OTP verification via SMS/Email to your forms for FREE.

== Description ==
**Gravity Forms - OTP Verification** allows you to add **One-Time Password (OTP) verification** to Gravity Forms, ensuring that users enter a valid mobile number or email address before submitting a form. It helps prevent spam, fake submissions, and ensures real user authentication.

### **Key Features:**
- 🔒 **Secure Mobile Verification** – Ensures users verify their phone numbers before submitting.
- ✅ **Seamless Gravity Forms Integration** – Works with all versions of Gravity Forms without conflicts.
- 🌎 **Supports Persian, Arabic & English Numbers** – Converts and validates all number formats.
- 📡 **Flexible SMS Gateway Support** – Connects to multiple SMS providers via built-in integrations or custom hooks.
- ⚙️ **Easy Setup** – Configure in just a few clicks with user-friendly settings.

== Features ==
- Add an Mobile OTP field to **any Gravity Form**.
- Prevent form submission **until mobile verification is successful**.
- Support for **multiple SMS gateways** including custom integrations.
- Fully compatible with **Gravity Forms’ conditional logic**.
- Users can **resend OTP** with a cooldown limit (e.g., **3 attempts, 90 seconds each**).
- Supports **hooks & filters** to extend functionality.
- Works across **all WordPress and WooCommerce sites**.

== Supported SMS Gateways ==
The plugin supports direct integration with popular SMS gateways as well as widely-used SMS plugins. You can send OTP messages using your preferred SMS provider or through supported SMS plugins for maximum flexibility.

- **Plugin: WSMS (formerly WP SMS) (over 300 gateways)**
- **Plugin: Persian WooCommerce SMS (over 100 gateways)**
- **Iranian Gateway: SMS.ir (v1/v2)**
- **Iranian Gateway: FarazSMS**

== Supported Email Gateways ==
The plugin uses the default WordPress email sending function (`wp_mail`). This means you are free to use **any email service** you want—whether it’s your web host’s built-in mail, your WordPress site’s configured SMTP settings, or a third-party SMTP plugin. Just configure your preferred email service, and OTP emails will be sent using that method.

You can also fully customize the OTP email: set a custom sender name, sender address, subject, and modify the email template as HTML directly from the plugin settings.

Additionally, you can add **any other SMS gateway** via **WordPress hooks and filters**.
